# Launch Success Rate Analysis

### ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This project analyzes the success rate of SpaceX launches over time and identifies factors that contribute to successful launches. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and key drivers of launch success using data analysis and visualization techniques.

### ðŸ“š Key Objectives
- Analyze Launch Success Rate Over Time:<br>
Track the success rate of SpaceX launches across different years.<br>
Visualize trends and patterns in launch outcomes.<br>

- Success Rate by Flight Type:<br>
Compare success rates for different types of flights. <br>
Identify which flight types have the highest and lowest success rates. <br>

- Payload Mass vs. Mission Outcome:<br>
Investigate the relationship between payload mass and mission success.<br>
Determine if heavier or lighter payloads are more likely to result in successful launches.<br>

- Predict Mission Success by using Random Forest Method <br>
Build a Random Forest classifier to predict mission success based on features such as payload mass, flight type, and launch site.<br>
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>

- Time series forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)<br>
Use ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to forecast future launch success rates.<br>
Analyze the accuracy of the forecasts and identify potential trends.<br>
